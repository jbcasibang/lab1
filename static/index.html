                <p>I believe that people are like onions. They are complex and often now sum up by a few layers but, that of countless layers of skin. Yet as we peel those layers in a quest to find out who they really are the fact remains. That this is a process that often makes us cry and they to lose so much. In the end I beieve that people are complex people full of surprises and wonderful things hence in the end I often fear them to no end as much as I love them.  </p>

                <p>Time is precious yet it is only given value by the acts that we commit with each passing second. It is often wonderful to see one grow from the things that they genuinely love and strive to be good to hence, as I have found out. No amount of critism should ever hold towards one's genuinely acts.</p>

                <p>Growing up I found out that the greatest invention of man is its ability to speak and interact with one another. Giving rise to its next best thing and that was stories. I often love how it feels to tell stories true or false and such because I believe that regardless of its status it is vastly important in how you deliver it in. </p>
