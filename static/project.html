<p>I would lack what one would call professional experience, the extent of my knowledge came from the classroom and what i could learn from my own independent learning. What little experience i have is made up for with my determination and my drive to learn more and become a proper game developer. The current project i have completed is known as Retrogun it will of course be considered an indie title. </p>
<br>
<p>It was a simple game meant to wet the appetite. It was the very first game i published on my own and it certainly wont be my last. This was a simple shooting guessing game that was meant to be enjoyed when one is simply trying to kill time. My future projects will be shown here and will have a link so that anyone that likes could see the progress I make.</p>
