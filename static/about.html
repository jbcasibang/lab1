          <p>Hello my name is Jose Ortiz, I am Hispanic male from Puerto Rico and have lived in different states thanks to my father who is in the military. Though I traveled to different places one thing was a constant and that was video games. I have seen the great strides that each new console has gotten since its previous creation. </p>

<br>

  <p> From the Original Xbox to the Xbox one, I have seen games that have made a grown made cry and i have seen games that made people rage quit. Throughout my younger years I have a wealth of experience in seeing these games and wishing to make my own someday. Nothing would bring me greater joy then seeing my game advertised and seeing how many people love it and saying "That's my game" so to that end I have started this website company.</p>
 <br>

  <p> I May have started creating games a bit earlier then I've liked but that hasn't changed my passion for the craft. A dear friend of mine [insert your name here] has helped me get to this point. I only hope to make many more games and become part of a triple A title someday. Know that when you play a game from Emerald Eye Gaming you aren't simply seeing a no name company to forget. You will be seeing the bloom of what will become a grand gaming empire, I only hope you stay with me as i endeavor to reach those heights </p>
