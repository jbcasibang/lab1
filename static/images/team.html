<p>Hello, the name is Jasfer Cid B. Casibang, The maker of this website. I was born and raised in the philppine and I did this to help out and plus it was fun trying to see if I still have the determination of making websites and most of it was fun. 
<br>
While its not the best its honest work and more importantly I get to help out and brighten someone’s day so I made this. Anyway an aspiring game dev like Jose I dream of making an RTS staring the philippines spanish colonial era up to the modern and space age as I believe that my history is as colorful and interesting as the people that it represents.
